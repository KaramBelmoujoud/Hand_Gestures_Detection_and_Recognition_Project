# Hand_Gestures_Detection_and_Recognition_Project
Project for detecting and recognizing hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time, allowing for gesture-based human-computer interaction.

The project involves capturing video data of a person's hand using a camera, then using image processing techniques to extract relevant features from the video frames, such as the position, orientation, and shape of the hand. These features are then fed into a machine learning model, which has been trained on a dataset of labeled hand gesture data, allowing it to classify the gestures based on the extracted features

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
https://github.com/oussama95boussaid/Hand_Gestures_Detection_and_Recognition_Project.git

Install the required dependencies. This project may require OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and other relevant libraries. You can install them using pip or conda:
- pip install opencv-python 
- pip install mediapipe
- pip install tensorflow

# Usage
Run the main script to start the hand and face detection and gesture classification pipeline:
python Hand_Face_Detection_Project.py
